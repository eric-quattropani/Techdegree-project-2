# Techdegree-project-2
 Data Pagination and Filtering 

This is my attempt of Project 2 going for a meets expectations grade. Although I understood most, if not all, of the concepts found in the instructions - I did find it a little difficult to start this one. 

The walkthrough was really helpful as it really simplified the thinking behind everything. It took me some time, but I learned a lot from this project!
